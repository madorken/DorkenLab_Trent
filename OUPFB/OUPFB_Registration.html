                  - Make sure you have all necessary travel documents <br>
                  <br>
                  <u> Detailed Information</u><br>
                  1) A $350 deposit is required for EACH course you want
                  to take. As of 2020, these fees may be paid by loading
                  the funds onto your student account. <br>
                  <br>
                  2) A complete OUPFB application form must be submitted
                  to Susan Chow or Marcel Dorken. Registration forms are
                  available at: <a href="http://www.oupfb.ca/info.html"><font
                      color="#666666">http://www.oupfb.ca/info.html</font></a>.
                  Indicate which alternate courses you would be willing
                  to take if your first choice is full. Only indicate
                  alternate courses if you are able/willing to take
                  them. If you want to take more than one course you
                  must complete an additional application form (one form
                  per course).<br>
                  <br>
                  3) You must provide us with an unofficial transcript
                  with your application. Normally only students who have
                  completed two years of undergraduate courses in
                  Biology and related disciplines will be considered
                  eligible. Exceptions to this will be considered on a
                  case-by-case basis. <br>
                  <br>
                  4) Make sure you have all the listed prerequisites for
                  each course you have listed in your application (your
                  first choice and all alternate choices). If you are
                  missing a prerequisite we will not register you for
                  the field course.<br>
                  <br>
                  5) At the time that you submit your application to us,
                  you will be required to register for the course with
                  Trent University. Note that this entails a separate
                  fee. You pay tuition to Trent, just as for any other
                  course and you pay the university that is hosting the
                  course a separate fee that covers only the cost of
                  running that course (e.g., accommodation,
                  transportation, meals, etc.). We will provide you with
                  a registration form that you return to us with
                  together your application. Note that you will not
                  receive a grade for the course unless you have paid
                  both fees. If this is your first OUPFB field course,
                  register for "BIOL 3850H". If this is your second
                  course, register for "BIOL 3851H" (third = BIOL 3852H,
                  fourth =&nbsp; BIOL 3853H). If you are taking the
                  course for an ERS credit, contact Dorothy Howard-Gill
                  in ERS. <br>
                  <br>
                  6) There will be an announcement giving the time and
                  location for submitting applications in January of
                  each year. If you are keen to take a particular course
                  (and especially one for which we have a reserved
                  spot), show up early on the day of registration. <br>
                  <br>
                  7) Course applications will be processed on a
                  first-come first-serve basis. If you submit your
                  application before other students for courses with a
                  guaranteed spot, you will be enrolled in that course.
                  If you arrive without having loaded the deposit amount
                  ($350) onto your student account we will not process
                  your application. If you showed up early enough to get
                  a guaranteed spot in your chosen course you will
                  almost certainly lose that spot.<br>
                  <br>
                  8) The payment of registration fees is refundable in
                  the way any other Trent course fee can be refunded.
                  However, <u>fees paid to the host university for the
                    running of the course are usually non-refundable</u>.
                  Course-specific policies on payment will be
                  communicated to you directly by the module
                  instructors. If you have purchased your own plane
                  tickets to attend the course, pay attention to whether
                  you can refund or re-book your flights in case your
                  plans change. <br>
                  <br>
                  9) You should hear within a few weeks whether their
                  place has been confirmed. At any time before the
                  course starts, a spot in the course may become
                  available if another student drops the course. If you
                  drop a course that you have been confirmed in then you
                  will lose your deposit unless the place can be filled.
                  The instructor will tell you when full payment is due.<br>
                  <br>
                  10) The host university will require you to sign an
                  informed consent waiver. The host university is
                  responsible for ensuring the safe operation of their
                  field courses.<br>
                  <br>
                  11) Students going on courses in foreign countries
                  must also contact the Trent International Program.
                  Before departure, provide emergency contact
                  information by registering with the Trent Emergency
                  Contact Program - available on-line through "MyTrent".<br>

                  <br>
                  We also recommend students register with Global
                  Affairs Canada at <a
                    href="https://travel.gc.ca/travelling">https://travel.gc.ca/travelling</a><br>
                  <br>
                  If you have any questions about the Trent
                  International Program or registering for the Trent
                  Emergency Contact Program, contact: <a
                    href="maito:studyabroad@trentu.ca">studyabroad@trentu.ca</a><br>
                  <br>
                  12) If you are taking a course outside of Canada, we
                  further recommend that you:<br>
                  <br>
                  a) purchase Travel and Health Insurance that includes
                  (a) cancellation insurance, and (b) emergency
                  evacuation and repatriation coverage in case of death
                  abroad. <br>
                  <br>
                  b) Copy all your travel documents (including passport
                  and health insurance) and leave the copies with your
                  next of kin in case of an emergency.<br>
