          <h2>The Ecology &amp; Evolution of Plant Reproduction</h2>
        </header>
        <a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Sag1.jpg" alt=""></a>
        <p>Immobility and modular growth have important implications for
          the ecological interactions (e.g., pollination, competition)
          that affect life-time fitness in plants. We study how these
          interactions drive the evolution of reproductive systems in
          plants. Recent projects include studies of how the resource
          environment influences the evolution of males, and how
          clonality influences mating patterns and overall plant
          fitness. Our projects typically include some combination of
          field studies, manipulative experiments, genetic analysis, and
          theory to examine the evolution of reproductive strategies in
          plants. </p>

            <h2>Evolution and ecology of combined vs. separate sexes</h2>
            <p> Separate sexes have evolved from hermaphroditism up to
              5000 times in the flowering plants alone. The transition
              from from hermaphroditism to separate sexes represents a
              major change in the way organisms reproduce; individuals
              give up the ability to be a maternal and paternal parent
              to their offspring and specialize as a female or a male.
              Our recent research has focused on how and why males
              evolve, testing core elements of sex-allocation theory.</p>

            <h2>Evolution and ecology of clonal reproduction</h2>
            <p>Clonal plants are widespread and often ecologically
              dominant but studies of the ecological costs and benefits
              of clonality lag far behind that of other reproductive
              modes. Using modeling and field experiments, we are
              investigating the consequences of clonality for mating and
              reproductive fitness. In particular, we are interested in
              evaluating whether clonality really does reduce mating
              success, as is generally thought, or whether it can
              enhance mating via the subdivision of reproductive effort
              among ramets. </p>

            <h2>Ecology of wind and animal pollination</h2>
            <p>Mating in plants involves intermediaries that transfer
              pollen to receptive stigmas. Regardless of whether these
              intermediaries are biotic (pollinators) or abiotic, they
              generally transfer pollen among near neighbours over short
              distances. Using field experiments we are investigating
              patterns of pollen dispersal in wind- and animal
              pollinated plants and integrating this information with
              spatial data to investigate topics such as spatial
              patterns of hybrid formation in invasive species and how
              patch structure influences the fitness of parents and
              offspring. </p>
